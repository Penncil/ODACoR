## Description
Time-to-event data, a frequently employed data type in clinical studies, serves as an essential source for investigating a wide range of outcomes, such as disease progression, adverse drug reactions, and hospital readmissions. Notably, when multiple time-to-event outcomes interplay, the competing risk model has advanced the analysis of multiple correlated events of interest. In the past decades, given the increasing number of distributed research networks, the exploration of multi-site studies focusing on time-to-event data analysis has emerged as a promising and essential research avenue. However, existing federated learning algorithms have been focused on analyses of a single outcome, without considering the complex interplay among multiple endpoints.

## ODACoR workflow

## Data analysis results
The current work creates new mathematical tools within a “one-shot distributed algorithms for competing risks model” (or ODACoR) for estimating the impact of risk factors on development of Long COVID. Applying these new algorithms to time-varying EHR data from children and youth, we find that the ODACoR approach surpasses meta-analysis, a more commonly used method, providing better identification of Long COVID risk factors and less bias in risk estimation, while also streamlining communication requirements across sites.
